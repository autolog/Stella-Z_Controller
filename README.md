# Overview

The Autolog Stella-Z Controller is a plugin for version 6+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It enables you to control Stella-Z (and similar) Thermostats directly from Indigo.

There will be a new revised Indigo 7 version in due course.

It is **strongly recommended** to read the [Stella-Z Thermostat Controller forum][2] documentation and information to familiarise yourself with the how the plugin works.
